<h2>Do not go gentle into that good night</h2>
<h3>Dylan Thomas (1914-1953)</h3> <!--Has everything beautiful been already said? Hope not.-->
<p><em>Dylan Marlais Thomas, born October 27, 1914, in South Wales, was the archetypal Romantic poet of the popular American imagination</em></p>


    <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
        
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
        Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
        
        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
        
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
        
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
        
        And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
        Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
